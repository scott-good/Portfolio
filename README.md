### Lotus Notes

For the 22 years prior to joining IBM in 2015, I was one of two owners of one of the earliest Lotus Notes Business Partners, Teamwork Solutions. Although Notes is widely criticized for its outdated user interface, there is no reason Lotus Notes applications have to look bad. Shown here are four examples I built as far back as 2005.

### PowerPoint presentations
