## Lotus Notes
![Image](04-LotusNotes.jpg)

For the 22 years prior to joining IBM in 2015, I was one of two owners of one of the earliest Lotus Notes Business Partners, Teamwork Solutions. 

Although Notes is widely criticized for its outdated user interface, there is no reason Lotus Notes applications have to look bad. Shown here are four examples I built as far back as 2005.

## PowerPoint presentations

Shown above and below are a variety slides from a range of PowerPoint presentations I built to promote our products. Throughout, you'll find simple, compelling graphics with easy-to-understand copy.

## Advertising flyers

IBM's Kenexa brand of talent management products had very little in the way of printed promotional materials worth showing to customers. At the request of one of my sellers I wrote, designed, and created the two flyers shown above and the 4-page flyer shown below (only 3 pages shown here).

## Connections Customizer wild examples

![Image](21-CustomizerYellow.jpg)

IBM Connections Customizer is an add-in product to IBM Connections which makes it possible for customers to add their own CSS and JavaScript to Connections pages to change the way they look and act. These examples were built as extreme examples of the kinds of changes that could be made...and were intentionally on the wild side.

## DQL Explorer

The DQL Explorer is a joint project between myself and Dimitri Prosper. Built using React for the UI and a Notes database for storage and some functionality, it provides a means for non-developers to use Domino Query Language to easily search and return data from Domino databases.
