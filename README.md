## A quick background
I have a broad background that includes artistic, business, software, and speaking/writing experience. I am both technical and aesthetic, an engineer as well as a graphic designer. The combination of these experiences and skills lets me both design and build beautiful and compelling things. Whether those things are innovative user interfaces, compelling PowerPoint presentations, or breakthrough advertising materials, the result is always the same: a logical, usable, and organized layout; easily understandable copy; and always, a beautiful look and feel.

## Lotus Notes
![Image](04-LotusNotes.jpg)

Prior to joining IBM, I was one of two owners of one of the earliest Lotus Notes Business Partners, Teamwork Solutions. My partner and I were introduced to Notes in its infancy but immediately understood how important it could become to businesses of all size. We ended up as one of the first 200 business partners worldwide (a group that eventually grew to more than 20,000). We installed the first Lotus Notes servers and custom applications in dozens of the world's largest corporations and, at one point, were identified as one of the 5-largest influencers of Lotus Notes sales among Lotus Business Partners around the globe.

These days, Notes is widely criticized for its outdated user interface and yet there is no reason Lotus Notes applications have to look bad. Shown here are four examples I built as far back as 2005.

## PowerPoint presentations

Shown above and below are a variety slides from a range of PowerPoint presentations I built to promote our products at IBM. Throughout, you'll find simple, compelling graphics with easy-to-understand copy.

## Advertising flyers

IBM's Kenexa brand of talent management products had very little in the way of printed promotional materials worth showing to customers. At the request of one of my sellers I wrote, designed, and created the two flyers shown above and the 4-page flyer shown below (only 3 pages shown here).

## Connections Customizer wild examples

![Image](21-CustomizerYellow.jpg)

IBM Connections Customizer is an add-in product to IBM Connections which makes it possible for customers to add their own CSS and JavaScript to Connections pages to change the way they look and act. These examples were built as extreme examples of the kinds of changes that could be made...and were intentionally on the wild side.

## DQL Explorer

![Image](DQLExplorer.jpg)

The DQL Explorer is a joint project between [Dimitri Prosper](https://dprosper.github.io) and myself. Built as a web-based UI using React on the front end and a Notes-based database for storage and some configuration functionality, it provides a means for non-developers to use Domino Query Language to easily search and return data from Domino databases.
